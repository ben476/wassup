            Hi Vlad! I'm a final year BSc student interested in being part of
            the Kagi R&D Team. I'll be doing my master's in the next couple of
            years, so I'll be available for part-time work in the foreseeable
            future. I felt that a job like this was right

          couple of years, so I'll be available for part-time work in the

          up my alley since it's essentially all I've been doing the past few
          years - part-time R&D work rapidly building new apps and prototypes.
          The "fire & forget" work style also sounds identical to how I've been
          operating at my past jobs as a Research Assistant. I usually just get
          a project brief and go define requirements, learn the skills required,
          and build it from the ground up on my own.<br /><br />As for the
          technical side, I've had experience in the listed qualifications
          (Python, Node.js, and web dev) since I was a 14-year-old jumping into
          freelance work (a particularly resourceful teacher tempted me into
          doing a 300-hour project for a $50 canteen voucher). Since then, I've
          expanded my skillset whenever I have free time and at my job to
          include everything I find interesting, such as AI, stuff with LLMs,
          video encoding and streaming, or how to spend my $300 of Google Cloud
          free credit in a week.<br /><br />I've attached my CV below. You'll
          find a lot of network engineering experience, but my passion lies in
          full-stack development, which I hope I can show my proficiency in with
          the test project.<br /><br />Thanks, Ben
